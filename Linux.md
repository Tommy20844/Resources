## Learning Path
Going through the Grasshopper section on [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) is the best way to achieve all of the Linux objectives. If you prefer reading books, [Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111898384X?linkId=41767d3a073f8d20ff0db23bb11a2ac7) will teach you all you need to know and more. If you choose this however, the text editing section on Linux Journey should still be done.

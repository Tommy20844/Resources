- Learning Path
	If you are especially interested in networks, I would recommend going through the entirety of [Professor Messer's CompTIA N10-007 Network+ Course](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-007/n10-007-training-course/) or reading [Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach](https://smile.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149). If this topic is of less interest to you, go through the [Networking for Ethical Hackers](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLKT__MCUeiyUKmYaakznsZeU4lZYwt_j) video series and then watch the relevant Professor Messer videos for topics that either confuse or interest you.
